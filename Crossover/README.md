Steps for Crossover:

* Install Crossover.

* Install Steam & Lethal Company in Crossover, then shut down the Steam bottle.

* In the Crossover app, right-click on the Steam bottle and click `Open C: Drive`.

  * Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Lethal Company` and copy the contents of the mod folder ("LowRes") into the game folder like before. I already removed the "Reserved Slot" mods.

  * See 8:11 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBnJmp58hn8

* In the Crossover app, in the Steam bottle, open "Wine Configuration". This will be at the right under "Control Panels". See 5:07 in the video above.

  * In the newly-opened "Wine Configuration" window, select the "Libraries" tab.

  * In the text box under "New override for library" type `winhttp`. Click "Add" then click "Apply" and close the window.

* Open Steam and run Lethal Company.

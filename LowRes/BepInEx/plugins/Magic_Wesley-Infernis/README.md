# INFERNIS
This moon was previously used for the mining of crystals and other various materials. <br>
But due to the increase of volcanic activity all sorts of insects infiltrated the facilities to seek refuge. <br>
Every employee within the building at this time was either devoured or cooked by the extreme heat. <br>
High value materials remain inside. <br>

There are 11 new themed scrap items to find on this moon. <br>
DIfficulty: A (between offense and rend)<br>

<h3>Can you survive the heat? </h3>

Whisky is an option that only works on Apple Silicon Macs (i.e. M1 or M2).

Steps for Crossover:

* Install Steam & Lethal Company in Crossover

* Copy over the mod folder into the Lethal Company folder in Crossover like before.

  * To find the folder, go to your Steam library, right-click on Lethal Company -> Manage -> Browse local files.

* Shut down the Steam bottle.

  * In the Crossover app, go to the Steam bottle. At the right under "Control Panels" click on "Wine Configuration".

  * In the new "Wine Configuration" window that was opened, select the "Libraries" tab.

  * In the text box under "New override for library" type `winhttp`. Click "Add" then click "Apply" and close the "Wine Configuration" window.

* Open Steam and run Lethal Company.

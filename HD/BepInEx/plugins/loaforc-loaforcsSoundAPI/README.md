# ADVANCED COMPANY CAUSES ISSUES, READ MORE
# loaforcsSoundAPI
A soundtool made to give Sound-Pack creators ultimate control, and users the ultimate experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Absolutely not meant as a replacement for [LCSoundTool](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/no00ob/LCSoundTool/) and [CustomSounds](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Clementinise/CustomSounds/). This sound replacement API is *much, much* more complex than either of those and is meant for advanced users.

## ADVANCED COMPANY ISSUES
Currently Advanced Company does some weird things to audio sources that can cause an incompatibility with loaforcsSoundAPI, for more you can see [this github issue](https://github.com/FluffyFishGames/AdvancedCompany/issues/130). Just know you may receive limited support with Advanced Company installed while we try and work out the issue.

## Ultimate Experience
loaforcsSoundAPI makes use of Multithreading, splitting sound loading into two steps. With very little effort [LethalResonance](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/LethalResonance/LETHALRESONANCE/) was decreased from 4 seconds of time during startup to just under 250 ms.

## Ultimate Control
loaforcsSoundAPI affords a Sound-Pack creator much more control over how their sounds are played and how they organise. 

A [simple tutorial](https://github.com/LoafOrc/loaforcsSoundAPI/wiki/Making-a-simple-Sound%E2%80%90Pack) to make a sound pack is available in the github wiki.
### Main Benefits
- Custom File Structure Hierachy
- Intuitive variations for sounds
- Mapping multiple sounds to the same sounds

<b>Comprehensive 400+ sounds and soon to be more! If you like the work please hit the thumbs up above!</b>
# WE'VE HIT OVER HALF THE SOUNDS USED IN THE GAME!

Immerse in 400+ enhanced audio tweaks and custom sounds for a scarier, deeper experience. Feel sound roll off objects, blending intense bass and subtle reverb for a captivating, immersive experience. Currently Only 57ish MB!

# SAFE FOR STREAMERS

This soundpack also contains completely custom sounds since we couldn't find any that properly fit our vision of horror in certain instances and also replaces more sounds than there are for certain creatures and sounds to give variety for a more fleshed out experience.

There are no memes in this soundpack, the goal is to be as focused on horror, immersion, and to be able to feel the audio "roll off of things" (The apparatus is the best example of what I mean by this)
